                ONE WITH A MISSIONARY HEART, RAGING AGAINST THE DYING LIGHT</p>
                <p>Saint Louis University as a CICM educational institution envisions the development of an integral human formation with its missionary identity. Every member of the Louisian community is to be fully conscious of the highlighted apostolic commitment of the University such as developing knowledge, skills and attitudes towards the promotion of justice, peace and human dignity geared in the realization of an interdependent working relation of the parts of the Judeo-Christian concept of person and of world. Having this harmonious outlook, one is inspired to provide service with Jesus as an example especially to the marginalized and to the oppressed. Primarily, imbibing the core values of Christian Spirit, creativity, competence and social involvement, Saint Louis University is deemed contributory to the development of the Philippines and total welfare of the people.</p><br>
